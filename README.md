# Weather-app-asmr-follow-along

Today I decided to do a code-along challenge to build a weather app. The app is my first time using API keys, and animation transitions in CSS. It was a lot of fun and I learned quite a bit debugging what I had messed up when typing out the original developers code. I also believe this is my first exposure to JSON in any form. 

Looking forward to learning more from these types of tutorials when I need a break from Codecademy. :)
